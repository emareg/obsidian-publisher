A method for processing documents and information. CORE stands for:

1. **Capture**: Store the input at a central place. Web, Notes, Talks, PDFs, Quotes whatever.
2. **Organize**: Classify and order all inputs. Put into calendar, docs, etc. 
   If it is a task that requires less than 2min, execute immediately.
3. **Refine**: Review/Re-Shuffle tasks or Reduce information.
4. **Express**: Express/Export information in own words. Engange/Execute a task.

Idea: Make it a CORE process: Capture, Organize, Refine & Review, Execute & Express


**Why Capture?** Quite simply, capturing allows you to get something off your mind. When a thought hits your brain, it can (and will) suppress all other thoughts until you do something about it.

> Your brain is made for having ideas... not for storing them.

**How Organize?**

> The wrong way to organize information is by where you found it. The right way is to organize by location where you will *use* the information. â€“ Tiago Forte
