Entropy = Number of possible states. Low Entropy means energy in a useful, condensed form.
Both, low and high entropy states are low in complexity. 

To understand the confusion around entropy, try to answer the question

> What does the earth get from the sun?

Earth gets energy in condensed low entropy form (high energy photon). The earth radiates the same amount of energy into space, otherwise it would heat up. But the energy is now in high entropy form (low energy, infrared radiation)

Entropy can only increase and this is what defines the “arrow of time”.

### Heat Death of the Universe
Black holes have high entropy. They emit radiation.
