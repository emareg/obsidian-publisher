Welcome to my “digital garden”, in which I grow and conserve the ideas for which my brain is too small. I sort all pages into 8 categories, which I believe cover all apects of human knowledge:

1. W: **World** Workings (physics, chemistry)
1. E: **Earth** & Environment (geology, agriculture, botanic)
1. B: Biological **Body** (medicine, health, zoology, vetinerian)
1. M: Mental **Mind** (philosophy, psychology, religion)
1. A: Aesthetic **Art** (music, painting, poems, sports)
1. S: Social **Society** (law, ethics, history, economics)
1. T: **Tech**nology & Tools (mechanical, electrical, engineering)
1. I: **Info**rmation Intelligence (math, informatics)


This page is a collection of ideas, articles, essays, and notes that I have written in Obsidian and published via GitHub.
